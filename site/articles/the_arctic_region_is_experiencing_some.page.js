<p>The Arctic region is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth. The melting of Arctic ice caps due to rising temperatures is a clear indicator of global warming. This not only affects local wildlife and indigenous communities but also contributes to global sea-level rise. The loss of ice also leads to a feedback loop, where dark water absorbs more sunlight and accelerates warming.</p>
