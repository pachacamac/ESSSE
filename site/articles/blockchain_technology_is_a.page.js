<p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. This technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It offers high security as each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
