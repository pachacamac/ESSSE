<p>Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning, is inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It is particularly effective in tasks that involve recognizing patterns, such as image and speech recognition. Deep learning has been fundamental in advancing fields like autonomous vehicles, where it helps in making sense of complex, real-time data like road conditions and traffic.</p>
