<p>Photosynthesis is a vital process in which green plants and other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. This process generates oxygen as a byproduct and is crucial for life on Earth. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and occurs in organelles called chloroplasts. The process is not just important for plants but also for animals, including humans, as it produces the oxygen we breathe and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
