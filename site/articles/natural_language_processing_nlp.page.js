<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable way. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. It is used in applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. The goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding, making interactions with machines more natural.</p>
