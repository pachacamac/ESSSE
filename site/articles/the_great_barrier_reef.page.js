<p>The Great Barrier Reef, located in Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system. Composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometers, it can be seen from space. The reef is known for its vast biodiversity and is home to a wide variety of marine life, including many endangered species. It is a popular destination for tourists, particularly those interested in snorkeling and scuba diving. However, the reef faces significant threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing, leading to widespread coral bleaching.</p>
