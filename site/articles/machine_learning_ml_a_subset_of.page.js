<p>Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves training computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. It uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from its patterns, and improve over time. ML is widely used in applications like predictive analytics, speech recognition, and image processing. The field is divided into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with distinct methods and use cases.</p>
