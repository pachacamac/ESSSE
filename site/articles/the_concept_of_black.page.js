<p>The concept of black holes in space has intrigued scientists and the public alike. Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. They are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity. The study of black holes challenges our understanding of physics, particularly the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Observing black holes and their effects on surrounding matter provides valuable insights into the nature of the universe.</p>
