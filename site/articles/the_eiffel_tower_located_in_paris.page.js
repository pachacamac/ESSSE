<p>The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. Constructed in 1889, it was originally intended as a temporary exhibit for the 1889 World's Fair. Standing at 324 meters tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Today, it's a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year.</p>
