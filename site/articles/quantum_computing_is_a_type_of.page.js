<p>Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. It represents a fundamental shift from traditional computing and has the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent and store more information than classical bits. Key applications include drug discovery, cryptography, financial modeling, and solving complex optimization problems.</p>
