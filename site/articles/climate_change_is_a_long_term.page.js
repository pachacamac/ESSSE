<p>Climate change is a long-term alteration in Earth's climate patterns, primarily due to human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. This phenomenon leads to global warming, resulting in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changing wildlife habitats. Combatting climate change requires global cooperation to reduce carbon emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable practices. It's a major challenge facing humanity, with significant environmental, economic, and social implications.</p>
